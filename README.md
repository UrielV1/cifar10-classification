# cifar10-classification
10 different objects classified using different CNN models

- In this work three different CNN models were tested
- The first model was pretty basic, including 3 convolutional layers. The test score was 71%
- The second model included 6 convolutional layers, as well as max pooling and batch normalization layers. The test score was 84%.
- The third model was in fact the same as the second, including data augmentation. It yielded the best reslut with test score of 87%
- For each of the models the hyperparameters were slightly tuned to optimize the results
