## 10 different objects classification using CNN models

- The dataset includes 50000 train samples and 10000 test samples
- Three different CNN models were tested in this work
- The first model was pretty basic, including 3 convolutional layers
- The second model included 6 convolutional layers, as well as max pooling and batch normalization layers
- The third model was in fact the same as the second, including data augmentation
- For each of the models the hyperparameters were slightly tuned to optimize the results
